# FriendlyForecast
A simple forecast up used in the Android Data Storage with SQLite workshop on Treehouse

Need to add a Constants.java class in /app/src/main/java/com/teamtreehouse/friendlyforecast/constants package which will contain your API key from Dark Sky API https://darksky.net/dev

```java
package com.teamtreehouse.friendlyforecast.constants;

public class Constants {
    public static final String API_KEY = "your API key here";
}
```
